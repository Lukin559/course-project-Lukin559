# Checkov scans cloud infrastructure configurations to find security misconfigurations
# https://www.checkov.io/

# Output format
quiet: false
compact: true

# Frameworks to scan
framework:
  - kubernetes
  - dockerfile
  - docker_compose

# Severity threshold (optional)
# check-type:
#   - CKV_K8S
#   - CKV_DOCKER

# Skip specific checks (with justification):
skip-check:
  # CKV_DOCKER_2: HEALTHCHECK instruction missing - we have it in Dockerfile
  # CKV_DOCKER_3: USER instruction missing - we have non-root user
  # Example: skip checks that don't apply to our setup
  # - CKV_K8S_8  # Liveness probe - may skip for simple apps
  # - CKV_K8S_9  # Readiness probe - may skip for simple apps

# Directories to skip
# skip-path:
#   - tests/
#   - .github/

# Enable soft-fail mode (optional - don't fail build on policy violations)
